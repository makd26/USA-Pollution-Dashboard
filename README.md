# USA-Pollution-Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard on USA Pollution Analysis

This project provides a data-driven dashboard that visualizes air pollutant levels across US counties and states for the years 2006–2010. The dashboard helps users analyze trends, identify regions with high concentrations of specific pollutants, and compare pollution levels by state, county, year, quarter, and pollutant.

Project Features
1. Data Overview
Coverage: Air Quality Index (AQI) data for major pollutants—Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)—from 2006 to 2010.

Geographic Scope: Includes all U.S. states, with drill-down to individual counties and select cities.

Customization: Users can filter and select by state, county, pollutant, and date range for focused insights.

2. Key Visualizations
Maximum AQI by Year and Pollutant: Track annual highest AQI values for each pollutant to monitor progression or improvement.

Maximum AQI by State: Compare the highest recorded AQI figures across states to identify pollution hotspots.

County & City Analytics: Drill down to specific counties and cities to examine localized air quality challenges.

Quarter-wise Pollutant Trends: Explore how seasonal changes affect pollutant concentrations.

3. Notable Pollution Insights (2006–2010)
Carbon Monoxide (CO):

Highest CO AQI: 150 (State: California, City: Mexicali, 2006)

Ozone (O3):

Highest O3 AQI: 211 (State: California, City: Mexicali, 2008)

Sulphur Dioxide (SO2):

Highest SO2 AQI: 200 (State: Oklahoma, various years)

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2):

Highest NO2 AQI: 115 (State: Colorado, City: Phoenix, 2006)

4. Interactivity
Filters for state and county selection allow users to analyze specific regions of interest.

Quarter-wise and year-wise segmentation highlights trends and potential regulatory impacts.

Using the Dashboard
Select Filters: Begin by filtering by state, county, pollutant, and date range for targeted analysis.

Review Maximum Value Tables & Charts: Identify peak AQI occurrences for each pollutant across various geographies and timeframes.

Quarterly Analysis: Examine pollution trends by quarter to spot recurring seasonal patterns.

Map Visualizations: Use in-built maps for geographical context and high-pollution area detection.

Key Learnings & Recommendations
Regional Hotspots: Certain states consistently show higher AQI values for specific pollutants—most notably, California and Oklahoma.

Urban Focus: Major urban counties/cities are regularly among the most polluted, underscoring a need for urban pollution mitigation.

Seasonal Variation: Quarterly breakdowns suggest significant variability in AQI by time of year, which may indicate influence from climate, regulatory measures, or population activit
